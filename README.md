# C_Shenanigans
I was feeling nostalgic and wanted to get back into some C programming.
I created this repo to create some C programs to get used to writing C again.

Go into one of the subfolders and run 'make run' to compile and execute the program.

/HelloWorld
  - Simple Hello World program

/Add
  - Has the user enter 2 numbers and adds them together

/RPS
  - Rock Paper Scissors game
  - User chooses rock, paper, or scissors by picking a number between 1-3
  - AI randomly picks an option
  - Game outputs the reults of the game and asks if the user wants to play again
  - After the user ends the game a tally of wins, loses, and draws is displayed
